=============================
Reference search in Vellumbot
=============================

This is a feature of vellumbot that allows a user to request a spell, skill,
feat, item, class, or race lookup right in IRC.  The user must use a command
such as .lookup and name a specific search domain, such as "spell", and the
interface will return the referenced item, using fulltext search to find it.

  19    CromGrum   ##> .lookup spell wenis*
  20    Vellumbot  ##> CromGrum: No SPELL contains "wenis*".
  21    CromGrum   ##> .lookup spell heal*

  22-26 Vellumbot  pm> (bot responds with top 5 matches to CromGrum in pms)

  27-31 Vellumbot  pm> (bot echoes to observer GMs in pms)

  32    Vellumbot  ##> Replied to CromGrum with top 5 matches for SPELL "heal*"

On line 3 CromGrum does the first search, which is not an exact match for
any spell.  As a result, the bot reports inexact matches to the requesting
user.

The general rule that Vellumbot follows, as in all other interactions, is to
"respond in kind" - that is, try to reply using the same conversational
context as it was queried.  If asked in a channel, it will respond in a
channel.  If asked in pm, it will respond with a pm.  In addition, as usual,
PMs to players will be echoed to the GM.

The requirements of search introduce a new behavior, though: for search
results (and only search results), the bot will respond with a private message
of the teaser texts if there are no exact matches (lines 4-8).

On lines 9-13, the same messages are also sent to the observer GM.

On line 14, the bot *does* "respond in kind", but only with the message that
it did a search, for the benefit of the others in the channel.  This message
would be sent via priate message if the user had made the request over private
message.

On line 15 CromGrum does another search.  This time there is an exact match.

On line 16, the bot responds with the brief description and metadata of the
spell which was an exact match.

Lines 17-18, are the result of a search with no matches, where the user did
not try to use a wildcard.  In this case the bot suggests using a wildcard.

Lines 19-20 are another search with no matches; CromGrum used a wildcard so
the bot does not suggest using one.

Line 21 shows CromGrum doing a search where the word part of the search is
an exact match for the spell, but he wants more results.  If he searched for
"heal" only, the bot would reply with the definition of Heal, so he has to add
a wildcard to get more results (lines 22-32).
