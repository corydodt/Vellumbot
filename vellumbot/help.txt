    %(commands)s
Commands can be used one of two ways, by hailing me or with ".":
    <Biff> VellumTalk: hello
    <VellumTalk> Biff, hello.
    <Biff> .hello
    <VellumTalk> Biff, hello.
I also understand dice aliases...
    <Biff> I roll [1d20+1]
    <VellumTalk> Biff, you rolled 1d20+1 = [16+1 = 17]
    <Biff> I roll [smackdown 1d10+17]
    <VellumTalk> Biff, you rolled smackdown 1d10+17 = [6+17 = 23]
    <Biff> I use a few more attacks, [smackdown] [smackdown]
    <VellumTalk> Biff, you rolled smackdown = [4+17 = 21]
    <VellumTalk> Biff, you rolled smackdown = [9+17 = 26]
And temporarily modifying aliases...
    <Biff> I use my super ninja [smackdown +20] on the unsuspecting peasant.
    <VellumTalk> Biff, you rolled smackdown +20 = [7+17+20 = 44]
I also understand "npc hijacking".
    <GeeEm> With a snarl, *grimlock1 takes a [bite 1d20+2] out of crime.
    <VellumTalk> grimlock1, you rolled bite 1d20+2 = [9+2 = 11]
