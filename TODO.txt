Init bugs and needs

    MFen can [init] twice 

    No way to remove an init from combat upon death.. maybe .x mfen ?

    No way to end combat, no count of rounds

    Doesn't tell you when two players are simultaneous (should print both at
    once)

Goonmill integration

    .goonmill <search terms> should download stats from goonmill - or goonmill
    plugin?
    
Maptool integration

    use tightvnc and run maptool online

D20SRD integration

    particularly .spell but also
    .skill
    .feat

Dice rolling

    still a little clunky.  Would like to eliminate all of the syntax except
    dice expressions and instead use search to recall actions.  Example:

    Joe> I shoot the grimlock with my bow. 1d20+8 1d6+6
    VellumTalk>> [1d20+8]
    VellumTalk>> [1d6+6]
    Ted> I shoot him too. 1d20+1
    VellumTalk>> [1d20+1]
    Joe> I shoot** the grimlock again
    VellumTalk>> [1d20+8]
    VellumTalk>> [1d6+6]

    VellumTalk searches Joe's chat history for the word shoot, and rerolls any
    dice on the line that it finds.  It does *not* use Ted's rolls.
